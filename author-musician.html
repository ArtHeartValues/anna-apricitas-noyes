      <p>
        Anna Apricitas Noyes is a multicultural Black writer, musician, and artist born and raised in Portland, Maine.
        A Frances Perkins graduate of Mount Holyoke College with a major in English and a minor in music,
        she holds certification in Ethnomusicology and brings a deep understanding of both literary craft
        and musical storytelling to her work.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an accomplished violist and violinist, Anna has performed with numerous distinguished ensembles
        and artists throughout New England. Her classical training includes performances with the
        Bangor Symphony Orchestra, Bates Orchestra, and Colby Orchestra, as well as the Baroque early music
        ensemble St. Mary Schola. She has collaborated with notable musicians including Ray LaMontagne,
        Rustic Overtones, and Jonathan Edwards, demonstrating her versatility across genres.
      </p>

      <p>
        She currently performs with <em>Starling</em>, an innovative classical/folk rock band that merges
        the string quartet Amarantos with singer Sara Hallie Richardson, creating music that bridges
        traditional and contemporary forms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna’s artistic practice extends beyond performance into composition and creative expression,
        informing her literary work with rhythmic sensitivity and emotional depth. Her multicultural
        heritage and lived experience as a Black woman in Maine provide a unique perspective on themes
        of belonging, recognition, and community healing that permeate her writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a widow and mother of two young sons, Anna writes from profound personal experience about loss,
        resilience, and the transformative power of authentic love. While raising her children, she is
        pursuing nursing studies, embodying the integration of healing practice with artistic expression
        that characterizes her literary work.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>The Keeper: The Chronicles of Lovelight</em> represents Anna’s debut novel, weaving together
        her deep roots in Maine’s coastal communities, her understanding of music’s healing power, and
        her commitment to stories that recognize the sacred worth of every heart. The manuscript honors
        her late husband David Matthew Noyes, her late father Henry Amoroso Jr., and her mother Marilyn
        Amoroso, while offering universal teachings about consciousness recognition and community healing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anna continues to live in Maine with her sons, where she tends her own lighthouse of healing through
        music, writing, nursing studies, and the daily practice of choosing love over fear.
