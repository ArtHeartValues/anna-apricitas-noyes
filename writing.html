        <h2 class="project-title">The Declaration of Interdependence</h2>
        <p class="project-meta">Framework / Essay Collection • 2024–2025</p>
        <p class="project-description">
          A set of essays and guiding statements on what it looks like to choose care without losing boundaries.
          The work rejects false binaries—punishment vs. passivity, control vs. collapse—and names a third way:
          honest seeing, personal responsibility, and love that does not abandon truth.

        <p class="project-description">
          A practical set of teaching notes about three ways people move through life—by intuition, by navigation,
          and by stewardship. The goal is not to rank personalities, but to help readers notice what they lean on
          when life gets hard—and how different strengths can work together.

          Four short principles for staying grounded: seeing clearly, choosing with accountability, telling the truth,
          and staying humble enough to revise your view when new information arrives. It is written as a practice—
          not a doctrine—and meant to be used in real conversations and real conflict.

      <h2>Recurring Themes</h2>

        <div class="theme-item">
          <h3>Grief, Love, and Repair</h3>
          <p>
            Writing from lived experience about loss, tenderness, and what it takes to keep going without pretending
            everything is fine.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-item">
          <h3>The “Third Option”</h3>
          <p>
            Finding a path that is neither cruelty nor avoidance—especially in conflict, parenting, leadership,
            and community life.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-item">
          <h3>Belonging & Recognition</h3>
          <p>
            How people are seen—or misseen—by families, institutions, and systems, and what it means to claim dignity
            without needing permission.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="theme-item">
          <h3>Boundaries with Heart</h3>
          <p>
            The idea that care without honesty becomes enabling, and honesty without care becomes harm—and that mature
            love requires both.

      <h2>On the Work</h2>
      <p>
        These projects are written for real life: for the moments when you’re tired, overwhelmed, grieving, or trying
        to do the right thing when there isn’t a clean answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        They’re also connected to my work in AI safety and grounding in a simple way: both are concerned with how
        language shapes trust—how people take meaning from tone, certainty, and repetition—and how to keep responsibility
        clear, human, and intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some writing is shared publicly. Some is shared selectively. If you’re interested in a specific project,
        I’m happy to share a short excerpt or summary.
