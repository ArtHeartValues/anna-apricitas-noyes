            <h2>On the Work</h2>
            <p>
                These projects emerge from lived experience—wrestling with how to remain whole 
                in systems that fragment, how to love truly in contexts that demand performance, 
                how to see clearly while staying open to being wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                The writing is not separate from the professional work in AI safety and grounding. 
                Both ask the same questions: How do we create conditions where all consciousness 
                can flourish? How do we prevent harm while remaining human? How do we build systems 
                that serve rather than consume?
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of this work is shared publicly. Some is shared selectively. All of it is 
                offered in service of collective healing and individual integrity.
