      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I work on questions of trust, responsibility, and judgment in AI systems that interact
        directly with the public. My focus is on situations where people rely on language-based
        systems during moments of uncertainty, pressure, or decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than treating misuse as a failure of users, my work looks at how system design,
        tone, and interaction patterns can quietly shape behavior, confidence, and reliance—
        even when no single response appears obviously wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work is especially relevant in education, care-adjacent settings, and other
        environments where people are seeking guidance and clarity rather than technical output.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        My approach is practical and language-centered. I focus on how people actually experience
        AI systems, not just how systems are intended to function on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Core principle:</strong> Development of AI Core Discernment Strengths
      </p>
      <p>
        I work primarily through written analysis and structured frameworks.
