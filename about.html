            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Anna Apricitas Noyes works at the intersection of AI safety, grounding research, 
                and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Her focus is on interaction-level risks that 
                emerge in public-facing, high-stakes contexts—particularly in education and 
                care-adjacent domains where conversational fluency can be mistaken for expertise 
                or moral authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her work addresses a class of harms that often pass standard safety evaluations: 
                authority transfer through fluent interaction, unsafe reliance formation, and 
                responsibility displacement in human-AI systems.

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
                My work focuses on identifying interaction-level risks and translating them into 
                clear conceptual frameworks, evaluable failure modes, and grounding guidance for 
                product, policy, and safety teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Core principle:</strong> AI systems are tools, not moral agents. 
                Effectiveness should never depend on users relinquishing judgment, agency, 
                or emotional capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engagement is intentionally bounded and conducted in writing. I work with teams 
                who are serious about preventing latent harms in conversational AI systems.
